These project involves a comprehensive data analysis workflow, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and insights generation. The objective is to transform raw data into meaningful information to support data-driven decision-making.

Key Steps in the Analysis:

Data Cleaning:
Handled missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
Standardized data formats and corrected errors.
Performed feature engineering for better analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Conducted statistical summaries to understand data distributions.
Identified outliers and trends in the dataset.
Explored relationships between variables using correlation analysis.

Data Visualization:
Created interactive and static visualizations (bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, etc.).
Identified patterns, anomalies, and key insights through graphical representations.
Used dashboards and reports for better data storytelling.
Insights & Findings:

Discovered key trends and patterns influencing business decisions.
Provided data-driven recommendations based on the analysis.
